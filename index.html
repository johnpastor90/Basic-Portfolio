                   <p>I'm a web developer in training, my name is John Pastor. I like working with computers, and aim to learn as much as I'm able to. In my free time I like spending time outdoors as well as hanging out with my dog Sombra. I also enjoy playing video games, reading about philosophy and building things. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. </p>
